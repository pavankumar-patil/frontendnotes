1.A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user hovers over it.
selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
button:hover {
  background-color: #F89B4D;
}

2.A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.
selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
}
p::first-line {
  color: blue;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
